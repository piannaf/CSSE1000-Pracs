All my completed pracs/labs including some useful resources.

The PDF files containing scans of handwritten materials are my own.
Several of the code files are my own or partially written by me.

I, Justin Mancinelli, hold the copywrite of the PDF files which I have
claimed as my own. All other files I put into the public domain with no 
restriction on distribution or attribution unless they be claimed by their true
copywrite holder.
